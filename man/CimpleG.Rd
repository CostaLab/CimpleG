\arguments{
\item{train_data}{Training dataset.
A matrix (s x f) with methylation data (Beta values)
that will be used to train/find the predictors.
Samples (s) must be in rows while features/CpGs (f) must be in columns.}

\item{train_targets}{A data frame with the training target samples one-hot encoded.
A data frame with at least 1 column,
with as many rows and in the same order as `train_data`.
Target columms need to be one-hot encoded, meaning that, for that column
the target samples should be encoded as `1` while every other sample
should be encoded as `0`.}

\item{targets}{A string specifying the name of the column in `train_targets`
to be used for training.
Can be a character vector if there are several columns in `train_targets`
to be used for training.
If this argument is a character vector, CimpleG will search for the
best predictors for each target sequentially or in parallel depending on the
value of `run_parallel`}

\item{test_data}{Testing dataset.
A matrix (s x f) with methylation data (Beta values)
that will be used to test the performance of the found predictors.
Samples (s) must be in rows while features/CpGs (f) must be in columns.
If `test_data` *OR* `test_targets` are NULL, CimpleG will generate a
stratified test dataset based on `train_targets` by removing 25% of the
samples from `train_data` and `train_targets`.}

\item{test_targets}{A data frame with the testing target samples one-hot encoded.
A data frame with at least 1 column,
with as many rows and in the same order as `test_data`.
Target columms need to be one-hot encoded, meaning that, for that column
the target samples should be encoded as `1` while every other sample
should be encoded as `0`.
If `test_data` *OR* `test_targets` are NULL, CimpleG will generate a
stratified test dataset based on `train_targets` by removing 25% of the
samples from `train_data` and `train_targets`.}

\item{method}{A string specifying the method or type of machine learning
model/algorithm to be used for training.
These are divided in two main groups.
* The simple models (classifiers that use a single feature),
`CimpleG` (default), `brute_force`, `CimpleG_unscaled` or `oner`;
* the complex models (classifiers that use several features),
`logistic_reg`, `decision_tree`, `boost_tree`, `mlp` or `rand_forest`.}

\item{pred_type}{A string specifying the type of predictor/CpG to be
searched for during training. Only used for simple models.
One of `both` (default), `hypo` or `hyper`.
If `hypo`, only hypomethylated predictors will be considered.
If `hyper`, only hypermethylated predictors will be considered.}

\item{engine}{A string specifying the
machine learning engine behind `method`. Only used for complex models.
Currently not in use.}

\item{k_folds}{An integer specifying the number of folds (K) to be used
in training for the stratified K-fold cross-validation procedure.}

\item{grid_n}{An integer specifying the number of hyperparameter combinations
to train for.}

\item{param_p}{An even number in `sigma / (delta^param_p)`. Tunes how much weight will be
given to delta when doing feature selection. Default is \code{4}.}

\item{quantile_threshold}{A number between 0 and 1.
Determines how many features will be kept. Default is \code{0.001}.}

\item{train_only}{A boolean, if TRUE, CimpleG will only train (find predictors)
but not test them against a test dataset.}

\item{run_parallel}{A boolean, if `FALSE`, the default, it will search
for predictors for multiple targets sequentially.
If `TRUE` it will search for predictors for multiple targets
at the same time (parallel processing) in order to save
in computational time. You need to set up `future::plan()` before running
this function.}

\item{save_dir}{If defined it will save the resulting model to the given directory.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{save_format}{Only used if \code{save_dir} is not \code{NULL}.
One of "zstd", "lz4", "gzip", "bzip2","xz", "nocomp".
\code{zstd} is the best option, fast compression and loading times, low space usage.}

\item{verbose}{How verbose you want CimpleG to be while it is running.
At 0, no message is displayed, at 3 every message is displayed.
Default is \code{1}.}
}
